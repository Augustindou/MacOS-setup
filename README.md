# MacOS Setup

This is an attempt at automating my MacOS setup. It's specific to my personal use but feel free to use it if you want.

```
cd ~/Desktop
curl --location https://github.com/Augustindou/MacOS-setup/archive/refs/heads/master.zip --output MacOS_setup.zip
unzip MacOS_setup.zip
cd MacOS-setup-master
chmod +x setup.zsh
./setup.zsh
```
